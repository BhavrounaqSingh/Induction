The day began with a peaceful *Path and Kirtan* engaging us to calm our minds and sing in unision the name of the lord. Moving further ahead our spiritual start was concluded by *Ardaas* which is our plea to the almighty to fulfill our wishes and desires for the upcoming future.
After the spiritual start we were offered refreshments and tea to keep our energy high for the upcoming events in the induction.
